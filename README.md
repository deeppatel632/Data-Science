# Data-Science

This repository contains Python notebooks and scripts covering foundational to advanced topics in Data Science. Each file is modular and covers a specific topic with examples, explanations, and code demonstrations.

## üìÅ Files Overview

### üîπ `BasicNumpy.py`
This script introduces the basics of NumPy, a core library for numerical computation in Python. Topics covered include:
- What is NumPy?
- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array attributes (shape, size, ndim, etc.)
- Data types and type conversions
- Indexing and slicing
- Array operations (arithmetic, relational)
- Useful NumPy functions: `arange`, `linspace`, `ones`, `zeros`, `identity`, `random`, `dot`, `exp`, etc.
- Iterating over arrays
- Reshaping, stacking, and splitting arrays
- Bonus functions like `np.where`, `np.full`, `np.eye`, etc.

Each concept is explained with code examples and output for better understanding.

### üîπ `AdvancedNum.py`
This script covers advanced usage of NumPy and includes:
- Performance comparison: NumPy arrays vs Python lists (speed and memory)
- Advanced indexing: Normal, Fancy, Boolean
- Broadcasting: Rules and examples
- Mathematical operations: sin, sigmoid, MSE, binary cross entropy
- Handling missing values (np.nan)
- Plotting: Basic 2D plots for various functions (linear, quadratic, sigmoid, etc.)
- Meshgrids (foundation for 3D plots and advanced data visualization)

Each topic is annotated with detailed explanations and examples.

## üìå Future Files (Planned)
Additional scripts will be added to cover:
- Pandas Basics
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Stats and Probability with Python
- Real-life Data Science Projects

Stay tuned and follow the repo for updates!
